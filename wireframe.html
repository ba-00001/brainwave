        <h1>Interface Design Report</h1>

        <h2>1. Theme and Metaphor Development</h2>
        <h3>Theme:</h3>
        <p>The theme for BrainWave Diagnostics is centered around neuroscientific exploration and advanced diagnostics. The platform aims to be both scientific and user-friendly, catering to a diverse user base including healthcare professionals, researchers, and concerned parents. The theme draws inspiration from the complexity of brain functions and simplifies them for user interaction, making cutting-edge AI accessible and understandable for all users.</p>
        <p>The design is meant to evoke trust, precision, and insight. Calm, professional colors such as soft blues and greens (for parents) and darker, more clinical tones like navy and gray (for professionals) are used to create a sense of reliability and innovation. The interface should look polished but not overwhelming, ensuring that users feel confident while interacting with the platform.</p>

        <h3>Metaphor for Interaction:</h3>
        <p>The interaction metaphor is based on waves and pathways, symbolizing the brainâ€™s electrical activity and the diagnostic journey. Users follow a smooth and intuitive flow, just like a wave, from uploading data to receiving actionable insights. The wave metaphor not only represents brainwave activity (which is integral to ADHD diagnostics) but also reflects the seamless process of navigating through the system.</p>

        <h2>2. Icons and Graphics</h2>
        <h3>Icons:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Brain Scan Upload:</strong> A stylized brain icon is used to represent the upload process, making it easy for users to identify where they can submit their fMRI, SPECT, or qEEG scans.</li>
            <li><strong>Reports:</strong> Data visualization icons, such as small graph icons and brainwave patterns, are used within the report section.</li>
            <li><strong>AI-Powered Diagnostics:</strong> An AI robot icon signifies the machine learning aspects of the platform, showing users that their data is being analyzed by advanced AI models.</li>
            <li><strong>Secure Data Handling:</strong> A padlock icon will appear on upload and report pages, indicating that all data is HIPAA-compliant and securely handled.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Screen Layout (Wireframes and Sketches)</h2>
        <h3>Wireframe Overview:</h3>
        <p>The BrainWave Diagnostics interface is structured around ease of use and clean navigation. The wireframe for this project has been designed with a focus on:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Entry Page:</strong> The landing page allows users to choose between two roles (Parent or Healthcare Professional) upon login.</li>
            <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5161dbb-c1fd-422c-a48f-dabb141bb37c" alt="Wireframe Entry Page" class="wireframe-image" />

            <li><strong>Dashboard for Data Management:</strong> Upon logging in, users are greeted with a dashboard containing sections for uploading brain scans, generating reports, and reviewing past reports.</li>
            <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/157570f8-834a-475b-a9d1-f0cc4cc26d2d" alt="Wireframe Dashboard" class="wireframe-image" />

            <p>The dashboard includes the following sections:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Upload Brain Scans:</strong> Prominently placed buttons guide users through the secure upload process for fMRI, SPECT, or qEEG files.</li>
                <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c2cb3181-8a1d-4147-962b-9f34bd1c0d85" alt="Wireframe Brain Scans Layout" class="wireframe-image" />
                <li><strong>Generate Reports:</strong> A section where users can request an AI-powered analysis of their uploaded scans.</li>
                <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aed08f05-925d-4fd7-8548-9c65e4f0a4c2" alt="Wireframe Generate Reports Layout" class="wireframe-image" />
                <li><strong>Previous Reports:</strong> Users can review past diagnostic reports and download or share them with medical professionals.</li>
                <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bdd12de7-b0ec-4c6b-ab95-ca7f2f42b8b4" alt="Wireframe Previous Reports Layout" class="wireframe-image" />
            </ul>

            <li><strong>Report Layout:</strong> After the data analysis is complete, users are redirected to the report page, which provides diagnostic outcomes. For parents, the report is simplified with visual aids and a summary that explains the likelihood of ADHD. For healthcare professionals, the report includes detailed metrics, such as dopamine transporter levels, functional connectivity maps, and more.</li>
            <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3663f11e-8c54-4c42-a71c-48ca8c74bbe8" alt="Wireframe Report Layout" class="wireframe-image" />
        </ul>

        <h3>Wireframe Sketches:</h3>
        <p>Sketches of the wireframe include placeholders for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Header/Navigation Bar:</strong> Links to "Upload", "Reports", and "Help".</li>
            <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/418dc38e-ff90-4286-80e9-4bdd8a2d922c" alt="Header/Navigation Bar" class="wireframe-image" />
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Media Content Production</h2>
        <h3>Video Elements:</h3>
        <p>A short walkthrough video (2-3 minutes) demonstrates how users interact with the BrainWave platform, from uploading scans to generating reports.</p>

        <h3>3D Brain Visualization:</h3>
        <p>For healthcare professionals, an interactive 3D brain model is available in the report section. This allows users to rotate and explore different brain regions.</p>

        <h3>Audio Guides:</h3>
        <p>Optional audio guides are included for parents, providing clear explanations of the diagnostic results in simple language.</p>
